 * it measures **characters** against a per-key budget derived from the
 * container (`i18n-budget.ts`). That catches the class of bug that actually
 * ships — a translated chip/badge/tab/button label too long for the fixed
 * width it was designed against — in CI, on every run, with no device.
 *
 * Data placeholders are stripped before measuring, because a student's name or
 * a stop's name is the same length in every language; only the *chrome* around
 * it is translated.
